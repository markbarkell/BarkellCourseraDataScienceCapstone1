# BarkellCourseraDataScienceCapstone1

The initial purpose of this repository is to hold some type of my work to implement the Capstone Project in the Data Science Specialization from John Hopkin's University having the portal of coursera.org.

The project has a presentation associated with it named PredictingNextWord.Rmd.   
This is a slide deck which is pretending to convince people to invest and use the system. 
But,the assignment limits the deck to five slide -- that way the reviewers or the investors don't get board to tears.

The PredNextWord.R is where most of the work to make the model and predictions from the model are housed.  
The model is called by the name model ba.   I think that I made the uncommitted all10.cnt.rds out of a previous version that limited the
number of rows to 500,000.

The app.R is the prototype's code.

I had done many other attempts and the repository has many files of iterative exploration.
